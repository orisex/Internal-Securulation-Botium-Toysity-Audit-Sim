🛡️ Internal Security Audit Simulation – Botium Toys
📖 Project Overview
This project is a fictional internal security audit conducted as part of a cybersecurity training course. The purpose was to assess the security posture of a simulated company, Botium Toys, using professional frameworks and tools. The project includes a review of the company’s assets, security controls, and compliance practices to identify vulnerabilities and recommend improvements.

📄 Disclaimer: This is a fictional case study completed for educational purposes. All company names, data, and scenarios are simulated.

🌍 Scope & Goals
Scope:
The audit covers Botium Toys’ full security program, including physical devices, internal network, systems, data storage, and employee equipment.

Goals:

Evaluate existing security controls and practices

Identify gaps in compliance and cybersecurity controls

Recommend improvements to enhance the company's security posture

📂 Assets Reviewed
On-premises office and warehouse equipment

Employee devices: laptops, smartphones, peripherals

Storefront and online retail inventory

IT systems: accounting, inventory, database, ecommerce

Internal network and internet access

Legacy systems and data storage solutions

⚡ Risk Assessment Summary
Risk Score: 8 out of 10 (High)

Key Risks Identified:
No encryption for sensitive customer data (PII, credit card info)

All employees have access to internal databases

No backups or disaster recovery plan in place

Weak password policies and no password management system

No intrusion detection system (IDS)

Impact:
High potential for data breach, regulatory fines, and business disruption due to poor data protection and recovery capabilities.

🔢 Controls & Compliance Checklist Summary
✅ Controls in Place:
Firewall

Antivirus software

CCTV surveillance and locks

Privacy policies and E.U. breach notification plan

❌ Missing or Weak Controls:
Least privilege access and separation of duties

Encryption for cardholder data

Strong password policy and centralized management

Backups and disaster recovery

IDS

Manual maintenance plan for legacy systems

⚖️ Compliance Issues Identified
PCI DSS:
❌ Fails in encryption, access control, and secure password handling

GDPR:
✅ Some privacy policies in place

❌ Lacks full data classification and inventory

SOC 1 / SOC 2:
❌ Missing clear access controls

❌ Missing complete data protection measures

🔧 Recommendations
Implement encryption for all sensitive customer data and credit card transactions

Adopt least privilege access and define user roles

Enforce strong password policies and implement a centralized password manager

Develop a disaster recovery plan and set up regular backups

Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time monitoring

Classify and inventory all data to align with GDPR and SOC requirements

Establish legacy system maintenance schedules with documented procedures

💼 Value of This Project
